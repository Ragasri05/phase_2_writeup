sudo: we run the command as root by adding sudo before it

nmap: open source tool for network exploration.

-sS :  this gives most users all the information they need. It scans thousands of ports per second, and because it doesnâ€™t complete a TCP connection it does not arouse suspicion.

-A: to enable OS and version detection, script scanning,and traceroute; 
-T4:for faster execution

then give the host name.

Step 3:

nikto: Scan web server for known vulnerabilities

-host: Host(s) to target. Can be an IP address, hostname or text file of hosts

give the ip address with port.

Step 4:

steps to get the flag

step 1:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4192e6-a800-4d15-a6c5-cce9c3920c99)

find the type of flag .

commands used : file

Step 2:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e4f8f4-1cb6-4ecd-90fd-da79d176b837)

found readable strings from the file 

commands used: strings 

step 3:

these strings different from other text.

step 4:

decode the text.

the string can be decoded using base 64 decoding.

step 5 :

open the link

ssh brute

step 1: looking for password in rockyou.txt (it is inbuilt file in kali linux). 

commands used: hydra -l username -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz ssh://ipaddress:port

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8bfee3a-a654-48fb-a654-e96a2ac18037)

password is bubbles

step 2: login to the ip address.

commands used:  ssh username@ip -p port

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9972bd50-90a2-47e0-88c6-8b13666f3063)

enter the password.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2798efa0-7379-45ed-9309-28f738418fc2)

step 3: list all the files

commands used: ls


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cef6c5d-456d-4669-aa67-a971f94828c2)

John loves Hashes 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d74bc252-70b7-4122-8a92-36c6dffc1450)

step 1:
identify the Hashes.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fae5a045-8f21-47ef-b597-eed0aac119db)

using hashid tool we can identify the type of hash.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbb6f6f-ac02-46ce-a15f-dcdbbc51e464)

install hashid using "sudo apt install hashid"

5.  is bycrypt(since it starts with $2b$). mode is 3200 
step 2:

create a text file with each hash in separate line.

commands used : nano

Step 3: 

install hashcat.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7547092f-d368-475a-9220-76f19fb5cb78)


use hashcat : Hashcat is a fast password recovery tool that helps break complex password hashes.

step 4:

know the mode of hash 

to get the mode use the command: "hashcat --help"

step 5: 

give the command : 

hashcat -m mode -a 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz --show

overly obfuscated

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/642e440e-de82-4578-9a9a-7d526ad8d104)

step 1: 

download the file and check for the type of file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2413dfa-9196-4f18-be76-62ca6bcc9986)

since the text is ending with two equal signs , checking it for base64 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ced1d540-72c3-426f-849d-830459729d5c)

so the text base64 encoded text.

step 2: 

decode the text

command used : "base64 --decode inputfilename.txt > outputfilename.txt"

then open the file using : cat outputfilename.txt

reapeated this till i got the flag
